### Note this project is meant for CSV files

To run this project go to the Main.java class. User input will be requested. 
The first input will be for the file name. If the file name you put in doesn't exist, 
then one will be created for you under the src/main/resources directory. If you type 
in a .csv file(created or not) you will be sent to the next prompt. This asks you for 
the headers of the csv file(ex. First Name, Last Name, etc..). Once you type in "D" you 
are then promted to fill in rows for the csv. Once you type "D" the file will be appened. 
Once done, the file will read and print out the contents of the csv.
